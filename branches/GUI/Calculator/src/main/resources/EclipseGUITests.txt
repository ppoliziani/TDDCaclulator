-- Test 1 -- 

I created a basic gui with a button and a label. I set it so that the label would toggle between the text "Label ON" and "Label OFF". I tested this by launching the gui and checking if by pressing the button the label updated

-- Test 2 --

Here I updated the gui by adding more elements. I added headers, a text box to enter the expression and another that returns it. The text entered would be printed in the result box when the user pressed enter.
