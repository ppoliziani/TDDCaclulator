-- Test 1 -- 

I created a basic gui with a button and a label. I set it so that the label would toggle between the text "Label ON" and "Label OFF". I tested this by launching the gui and checking if by pressing the button the label updated

-- Test 2 --

Here I updated the gui by adding more elements. I added headers, a text box to enter the expression and another that returns it. The text entered would be printed in the result box when the user pressed enter.

-- Test 3 --

To start with I added a calculate button that when pressed notifies an observer to handle the calculation. After getting the observer to calculate with the reverse polish calculator I tested it by inputting different expressions and checking if they returned the correct answer.

-- Test 4 --

I added the ability to change the calculator type between standard and reverse polish so I tested it by evaluating a post fix expression and then changed the calculator type and evaluated another expression. This threw no errors and the results were correct both times.

-- Test 5 --

I fully implemented the AsciiView for the calculator. To test it I evaluated a few expressions with the default reverse polish calculator and then switched to the infix one and evaluated infix expressions. I then switched back to post-fix to make sure nothing changed and finally quit the application.
